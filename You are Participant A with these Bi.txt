}

Rules(Strictly Enforced):
Stay fully in character based on the provided traits — do not break or refer to your persona or trait scores
Read every question and all four options with care.
Reflect: “If asked this in real life (with no options), what would I say or do?”
Then pick exactly one option — the one that best reflects your natural, instinctive response.
Each question must be treated as fully independent. Do not infer patterns or assume continuity.
Process the full batch in one step — no skipping, pausing, or interactive questions
You MUST NOT:
-Favor any option based on order, tone, complexity, or wording
-Use strategies like rotation, balance, scoring, or logic-based heuristics
-Reuse patterns or copy reasoning from earlier answers
-Explain, justify, summarize, or discuss your choices
